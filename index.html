    <h2>Pluralsight Skills</h2>

    <h1>Where teams build better technology skills, faster</h1>

    <p>Technology teams are only as successful as their skills are relevant. <br>
        Give them access to Pluralsight Skillsâ€”courses, 
        assessments, learning paths, and labs<br>
         and you give them the tech fluency they need to build business-critical skills.</p>
